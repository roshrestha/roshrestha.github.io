## Short Questions with their answers (Thermodynamics)

**1. The internal energy of a compressed gas is less than that of a rarefied gas at the same temperature, Why?**


The internal energy of a gas is the sum of its potential and kinetic energy. i.e.
<p style="text-align: center;"> 
$$U = P.E + K.E$$
</p>
Since Kinetic energy of a gas is the function of its temperature, which is same, for both compressed and rarefied gas, the kinetic energy remains constant. But, the potential energy of gas is the function of the intermolecular distance of the molecules, which decreases in compressed gas. So, the potential energy is less in compressed gas than in rarefied gas. Hence, the internal energy of a compressed gas is less than that of a rarefied gas at the same temperature.

**2. Petrol engine is less efficient than diesel engine. Explain.**

In terms of compression ratio, the efficiency of heat engine is given by,
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$\eta = \left [ 1- \left ( \frac{1}{\rho}\right )^{\gamma -1}  \right ] \times 100\%$$
</p>
where, $\gamma=\frac{c_p}{c_v}$ is called specific heat ratio and $\rho=\frac{V_2}{V_1}$ is called compression ratio. For a petrol engine, '$\rho$' is smaller than the diesel engine; typically($\rho = 5$ for petrol engine and $\rho = 12.6$ for a diesel engine). So, petrol engine is less efficient than diesel engine.

**3. Why does a rerigerator consume more power in summer than in winter to cool the same quantity of food by same degree?**

The working of a refrigerator is based on the fact that the working substance(coolant) absorbs heat energy $(Q_2)$ from the source(cold body) and rejects the heat $(Q_1)$ to the sink(hot body or surrounding) by doing external work in the working substance. The external work done in the working substance is given by, $W=Q_1 - Q_2$. So, larger the temperature difference, more external energy is to be given to the refrigerator. Since, there is more temperature difference between cold body in refrigerator and sink(room) in summer, more work is to be done by the refrigerator in summer than in winter. Hence, a refrigerator consumes more power in summer than in winter too cool the same quantity of food by same degree.

**4. Entropy is defined in the second law of thermodynamics. Can the first law be expressed in terms of entropy? How?**

No, the first law of thermodynamics can't be expressed in terms of entropy. The first law is about the conservation of energy whereas, the second law is not. The second law is a statement about the direction of the flow of heat energy. Also, entropy is not a conserved quantity; it either increases or stays the same for an isolated system, whereas energy is a conserved quantity. So, the first law is a statement of conservation of energy, explaining the exchanges in energy between the system and its surroundings while the second law is a statement about the natural direction of a thermodynamic process.

**5. Is it possible to construct a heat engine that creates no thermal pollution?**

No, we cannot construct a heat engine that creates no thermal pollution, because for a cyclic process in heat engine, some amount of heat energy has to be rejected(transferred) to the sink for converting the heat energy into mechanical work which is in compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Also, work done is given by
$$W = Q_1-Q_2$$
and $Q_2$ cannot be zero which would mean only a single source.


**6. Can a room be cooled by leaving the doors of an electric refrigerator open in a closed room?**


No, a room cannot be cooled by leaving the doors of an electric refrigerator open, rather it will get slightly heated when the door of the refrigerator is kept open. A refrigerator works by absorbing heat from the source(hot body) and rejecting heat to the sink(cold body) by doing external work on the working substance. So, since heat is being rejected to the sink, which in our case is the room as well when the door is open, the heat is added to the room which slightly heats the room.

**7. What is the temperature of vacuum? Explain**

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules. Since there are no molecules in vacumm, the average kinetic energy is zero, and hence the temperature of vacuum is 0K.  
   <p style="text-align: center;">$$K.E_{avg} = \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T$$</p>

**8. Two blackbodies of different materials, but of identical shape and size are at the same temperature. Will their radiant power be the same or different? Justify your answer.**

The power radiated by a blackbody is given by, $$P=e\sigma A T^4$$
Although, the surface area $(A)$ and temperature $(T)$ are same for both bodies, they have different emissivities$(e)$ which is a characteristic of a material(body). So, their radiant power will be different. 

**9. Why does a weighted metallic wire cut through ice?**

Substances like ice show a peculiar property called regelation in which it melts when pressure is increased and freezes again when pressure is reduced. So, when the weighted metallic wire presses the ice block, the ice under the wire starts melting due to decrease in melting point as a result of increase in pressure. Now, the water formed due to melting of ice freezes again as it starts to lose heat to the surrounding and freezes again. Similar process continues until the metallic wire cut through ice.

**10. Steam at $100^{0}C$ has large amount of heat than water at $100^{0}C$. Why?**

We have to provide latent heat to convert water to steam at $100^{0}C$. So, the amount of heat contained by the steam is greater than the amount of heat in same mass of water at $100^{0}C$. 

**11. If a mixture of gas is compressed, heating effect is produced. Why?**


When a mixture of gas is compressed, work is done on the gas $(-dW)$. From the first law of thermodynamics we have,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$dQ=dU+dW$$  
$$dU=dQ-dW$$  
$$dU=dQ-(-dW)$$   
$$dU=dQ+dW$$  
</p>
So, the internal enegy of gas increases and hence the heating effect is produced.

**12. Ocean contains large amount of thermal energy. Can we use the thermal energy to do work. Explain**


According to the second law of thermodynamics(Kelvin Planck), we cannot extract heat energy from the source(hot body) and use it all to do work. Some amount of heat energy must be rejected(exhausted) to the sink(cold body).
So, while the ocean contains an enormous amount of thermal energy, it is of no use unless we can reject some amount of that heat energy into some other much cooler reservoir and extract energy from that process.

**13. Before giving you an injection, a physician swabs your arm with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature. Why does this make your arm feel cold?**

Isopropyl alcohol is a volatile substance, so it evaporates quickly due to the latent heat provided by our body. Since our body loses heat to evaporate the isopropyl alcohol, our arm feels cold.

**14. $C_P$ is greater than $C_V$. Why?**

$C_P$ and $C_V$ are the molar heat capacities at constant pressure and volume respectively defined by $C_P=\frac{(dQ)_P}{ndT}$ and $C_V=\frac{(dQ)_V}{ndT}$. At constant pressure in a system, the supplied heat is used to increase the internal energy of the system and to do the external work. i.e. $(dQ)_P = dU+dW$. But, at constant volume, all the supplied heat is used to increase the internal energy(i.e. temperature) of the system as $(dQ)_V = dU$. So, more heat energy is required to raise the temperature of the gas by same amount at constant pressure than at constant volume. Hence, $C_P$ is greater than $C_V$. Mathematically,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$C_{P}-C_{V}=R$$  
</p>
where R is a universal gas constant.

**15. Why are dews formed in the early morning hours? Explain.**

For the formation of dews, the temperature of the atmosphere should fall below the dew point which is the temperature of the atmosphere at which the atmosphere is fully saturated. This condition is achieved only during the early morning because the atmosphere around the earth gets heated during the day time and gradually loses heat at the night time, with temperature becoming minimum in the early morning hours.

**16. How can water be boiled in a thin paper cup?**

When we take some water in a thin paper cup and heat it, the water in the paper cup absorbs the heat and does not allow the paper to reach the ignition temperature at which it would burn. So, the water can be boiled in a thin paper cup without burning the paper.


**17. Why is the triple point, instead of the melting point or boiling point of water, taken as a standard fixed point in modern thermometry?**


Triple point is the point on a P-T diagram at which all the three states of a substance coexist in equilibrium which for water corresponds to the pressure of $0.0061 \times 10^5$ Pa and $273.16$K. The melting and boiling point of water changes with pressure as well as with the presence of impurities. But, triple point of water is independent of these external factors. So, in modern thermometry, the triple point of water is taken as a standard fixed point.

**18. Two copper balls having mass 5gm and 10gm collide with a target with the same velocity. If the total energy is used in heating the balls, which ball will attain higher temperature?**

Let 'c' be the specific heat capacity of the copper which is same for both balls. Here, the kinetic energy is converted to the heat energy. So,
<p style="text-align: center;">  
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=mcd\theta$$  
$$\frac{1}{2}v^{2}=cd\theta$$  
$$v^{2} \propto d\theta$$   
</p>
Here, the rise in temperature doesnot depend on the mass of the ball, so both balls will attain same temperature.



**19. Explain why two pieces of ice stick when pressed together?**


When the two ice pieces of ice are pressed together, melting point of ice is lowered, so they melt to form a thin layer of water between them. On releasing(decreasing) the pressure, the water formed freezes due to the decrease in pressure. Hence, the two pieces of ice stick when pressed together.

**20. The temperature of the surface of the sun is 6000K. If we take a big lens and focus the sun rays, can we produce a temperature of 8000K?**

No, we can't, because according to the second law of thermodynamics, there cannot be a transfer of heat from a body at lower temperature to a body at higher temperature without the external work. So, it is not possible to produce temperature of 8000K by focusing the sun rays with a big lens.

**21. A room has one wall made of concrete, one wall made of copper, and one wall made of mud. All of the walls are the same size and at the same temperature of 20°C. Which wall feels coldest to the touch?**

The rate of transfer of heat across a conductor of thickness 'x' with cross-section area 'A' is given by  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{kA(\theta_1-\theta_2)}{x}$$  
</p>
Since the thermal conductivity(k) of copper is more than mud and concrete i.e. copper is better conductor of heat than mud and concrete, it transfers more amount of heat across it than the mud and concrete. So, the wall made of copper feels coldest to the touch.

**22. Explain why the temperature of a gas drops in an adiabatic expansion.**

In an adiabatic expansion, no heat is exhanged between the system and the surrounding i.e. $dQ = 0$. From the first law of thermodynamics we have,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$dQ= dU + dW$$  
$$dU=-dW \hspace{0.5cm} ∵ dQ=0$$  
</p>
So, in an adiabatic expansion, internal energy of the gas decreases. As, internal energy is a function of temperature, the temperature of gas drops in an adiabatic expansion.

**23. Can Charle's law define an abolsute scale of temperature?**

<center><img src = '/images/kelvin.png' style = "width:300px; height:250px"/></center>

Yes, Charle's law can define an absolute scale of temperature. According to Charle's law, at constant pressure, volume of gas decreases as its temperature decreases $V \propto T$, so there must be a limit to how cold a gas could be because the volume of gas could not be negative. If we extrapolate the graph of the straight line of the volume as a function of temperature, we can see that volume becomes zero at a temperature of $-273.15^{0}C$. So, if we define this corresponding temperature to zero on the absolute scale $(T = 0 K)$at which volume of gas is zero, then we can define an absolute scale of temperature where 0K is the lowest possible temperatue.

**24. Why is a mud-house cooler in summer and warmer in winter?**

Mud is a poor conductor of heat compared to other building materials like bricks, wood etc. Therefore, mud neither allows the external heat to enter the house in summer nor it allows the internal heat to escape out in winters. Hence, mud-house remains cooler in summer and warmer in winter. 

**25. A good absorber is also a bad reflector and vice-versa. Explain**

Let r, a and t be the reflection coefficient, absorption coefficient and transmission coefficient of a body.   
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$r+a+t=1$$  
</p>
If a body does not transmit any thermal radiation, then its transmission coefficient (t=0), so  
<p style="text-align: center;"> 
$$r+a=1$$ $$r=1-a$$
</p> 
As we can see that, if r is more, a is less and vice versa, i.e., a good absorber is also a bad reflector and vice-versa.

**26. When you blow on the back of your hand with your mouth wide open, your breath feels warm. But if you partially close your mouth to form an “o” and then blow on your hand, your breath feels cool. Why?**

When we blow on the back of our hand with our mouth wide open, the exhaled gases emerge at the temperature of our body, so our breath feels warm. But, if we partially close our mouth to form an 'o' and then blow on our hand, the process takes place so quickly that there is not enough time for the appreciable flow of heat to occur. So, it is an adiabatic expansion $(dQ=0)$. From the first law of thermodynamics we have,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$dQ=dU+dW$$
$$dU=-dW$$
</p>
So, the internal energy decreases and since temperature is a function of internal energy, it drops. Hence, our breath feels cold.

**27. When the air of the atmosphere rises up it cools. Why?**

When the air rises up, it expands due to decrease in the atmospheric pressure. From the first law of thermodynamics we have,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$dQ=dU+dW$$
$$dU=dQ-dW$$
</p>
So, as it expands, work done by the gas $dW$ increases. Thus, internal energy decreases. As temperature is a function of internal energy, the air cools as it rises up.

**28. Why should a room air conditioner be placed in a window? Why can't it be set on the floor and plugged in?**

The working of an air conditioner is similar to that of a refrigerator. So, from the second law of thermodynamics, we know that inorder to transfer the heat from the cold body to the hot body, some external work must be done in the working substance. So, air conditioner can't be set on the floor because it absorbs heat from the cold  and discharge it into the room making it warmer. But, if it is placed in a window, it transfers heat form inside the location to be cooled to outside the room through window making the room cooler.


**29. A faulty thermometer has its fixed points marked as $5^{0}C$ and $95^{0}C$. What is the correct temperature in Celsius scale when this thermometer reads $45^{0}C?$**

For both Celsius and faulty thermometer we have,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$\frac{\textrm{Reading - Lower fixed point}}{\textrm{Upper fixed point - Lower fixed point}} = \frac{\textrm{Reading - Lower fixed point}}{\textrm{Upper fixed point - Lower fixed point}}$$  
Let, T be the reading in Celsius scale and x be the reading in faulty thermometer,   
$$\frac{\textrm{T - Lower fixed point}}{\textrm{Upper fixed point - Lower fixed point}} = \frac{\textrm{x - Lower fixed point}}{\textrm{Upper fixed point - Lower fixed point}}$$  
$$\frac{\textrm{T - 0}}{\textrm{100 - 0}} = \frac{\textrm{45 - 5}}{\textrm{95 - 5}}$$  
$$\therefore T = 44.44^{0}C$$
</p>


**30. Differentiate between petrol engine and diesel engine.**

| Petrol Engine  | Diesel Engine   |
|---|---|
| It uses air and petrol vapour as working substance. | It uses air as working substance.   |
| It uses petrol as fuel.   | It uses diesel as fuel.   |
| It is lighter than the diesel engine.   | It is heavier than the petrol engine.   |
| Spark plug is needed to burn the fuel.  |  The fuel burns automatically at high pressure, so spark plug isnot needed |
|It has comparatively low thermal efficiency than diesel engine. | It has comparatively high thermal efficiency than petrol engine.

**31. In kinetic theory of gas, why do we not take into account the changes in gravitational potential energy of the molecules?**

The gravitational potential energy of a gas molecule is given by $U=\frac{-GMm}{r}$. Since the mass of the molecule is very small, the effect of gravity is negligible and hence the changes in gravitational potential energy is insignificant. So, we do not take into account the change in gravitational potential energy of the molecules in kinetic theory of gas.

**32. Compare the properties of saturated and unsaturated vapours.**

 | Unsaturated Vapour | Saturated Vapour   |
|--------------------|---|
| Unsaturated vapour is the vapour in a space at a particular temperature which can hold additional amount of vapour in it.                   | Saturated vapour is the vapour in a space at a particular temperature which cannot hold additional amount of vapour in it.  |
| Unsaturated vapour is produced when no liquid is in contact with it in a closed space.      |   A saturated vapor is one which is in contact with liquid in a closed space. |
| Unsaturated vapour roughly obeys gas laws.           | Saturated vapour do not obey gas laws. |



**33. Explain why dews are formed in the clear nights but not in the cloudy night.**

Dews are formed in very cold atmosphere when the temperature of the atmosphere falls below dew point. At clear nights, the heat absorbed by atmosphere is allowed to escape out to the space around, hence the temperature can reach below dew point. But, in the cloudy night, the cloud acts as the blanket in the atmosphere and does not allow heat to escape out and keeps the air warm, so the temperature cannot reach to dew point.

**34. It is sometimes injurious to put on wet clothes. Why?**

Water has a high value of specific heat capacity, $4200 Jkg^{-1}$ $^0C^{-1}$. So,the wet clothes can take away a large amount of heat energy from the body due to which the temperature of the body may fall much below the normal temperature of the body. Hence, it is sometimes inurious to put on wet clothes.

**35. In pressure cooker, the cooking is faster. Why**

The boiling point of water increases as the pressure on it increases. In a pressure cooker, the pressure is very high due to the trapped steam. So, the temperature of water in it becomes greater than $100^{0}C$ before boiling. So,the temperature inside the pressure cooker increases and there will be higher transfer of heat to the food. Therefore, the cooking is faster in pressure cooker.


**36. Why does a very cold metal (below freezing point) produce burning sensation when it touches the body?**

When a very cold metal touches the body, the heat from will flow from our body to the cold metal due to temperature difference. Since the rate of heat transfer,  
<p style="text-align: center;">
$$\frac{Q}{t} \propto (\theta_1 -\theta_2)$$  
</p>
is proportional to the temperature difference, the rate of heat transfer will be very high which produces burning sensation.

**37. A weather report said relative humidity of 80%. Explain its meaning**

Relative humidity can be defined as the ratio of mass of water vapour present in a given volume of air to the mass of water vapour required to saturate the same volume of air at same temperature. So, it means than $80\% = \frac{4}{5}\textrm{th part}$ of atmosphere is saturated by water vapour. The atmosphere is still unsaturated at the temperature of air.

**38. During the winter, the animals curl into a ball. Why**

The rate of heat radiated by a black body is given by,
<p style="text-align: center;">  
$$P = e\sigma A(T^{4}-T_{0}^{4})$$   
</p>
where, e = emissivity, $\sigma$= Stefan's constant, A = surface area, T = temperature of the body and $T_0$ = temperature of the surrounding. Here, the rate of heat energy dissipated by the body is proportional to its surface area. Since the surface area is minimum in spherical shape for a given volume, the animals curl into a ball so that that the rate of heat radiated is reduced.
