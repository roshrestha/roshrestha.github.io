### Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment

The experimental arrangement for the Millikan's oil drop experiment is shown in Fig. 

![milloil](/images/milloil.png)

​                            **Fig: Experimental arrangement for Millikan's oil drop experiment **

It consists of two parallel metal circular plates A and B with upper plate A maintained at high potential by connecting it to a high tension battery while the lower plate B is earthed so that the region between the plates is a region of uniform electric field. The upper plate has a hole H at is centre through which small charged oil drops are sprayed in the region between plates. The oil drops are  charged due to friction with air when squeezed through the atomizer. The whole arrangement is kept inside double walled jacket in which cold water keeps on circulating so that the internal temperature remains constant. This jacket also helps to prevent the zigzag motion of oil drop which would otherwise arise due to the convection current of air set up by the external conditions. 

The jacket is also provided with three openings $W_1$, $W_2$, and $W_3$ in the form of windows. Window $W_1$ has an electric bulb to illuminate the region between the plates. Window $W_2$ has a source of X-ray that may be used to charge the oil drop, if the friction with the air is not sufficient enough to charge it. The window $W_3$ has a travelling microscope which would help to calculate the terminal velocity acquired by oil drop by measuring the distance travelled by it.

This experiment is carried out in two steps:

**i) Motion of oil drop under the effect of gravity alone ** 
First of all, the charged oil drop is allowed to fall under the action of gravity alone by switching off the electric field. As the oil drop falls, its velocity keeps on increasing until a stage reaches when the net force acting on the oil drop becomes zero i.e. the upward forces; upthrust and viscous force equals the downward force; gravity. Now, the oil drop falls with the constant velocity called $v_1$ called terminal velocity.

Let, m = mass of oil drop 

​        r = radius of oil drop

​        $\rho$ = density of the oil

​       $\sigma$ = density of air

​       $\eta$ = coefficient of viscosity of air

For, Net force = 0

​		Upthrust + viscous force = weight           

​       or,  Volume of air displaced x density of air x acceleration due to gravity + $6\pi\eta r v_1$ = mass of oil drop x acceleration due to gravity

 	 or,  Volume of oil drop x density of air x acceleration due to gravity + $6\pi\eta r v_1$ = mass of oil drop x acceleration due to gravity

​	 or, $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\sigma g$  + $6\pi\eta r v_1$ = $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho g$ 

​     or, $6\pi\eta r v_1$ = $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3(\rho - \sigma) g$  ........................................................................... (i)	 

​    $$r = \sqrt{\frac{9\eta v_1}{2(\rho - \sigma)g}}$$                         ........................................................................... (ii)

**ii) Motion of oil drop under the combined effect of electric field and gravity** 

Now, the experiment is conducted by applying a strong electric field between the plates so that the electric force due to the electric field on the identical oil drop which is negatively charged acts on the vertically upward direction. Again, the velocity of oil drop keeps on increasing in upward direction until a stage reaches when the net force acting on the oil drop becomes zero i.e. the upward forces; upthrust and electric force equals the downward force; gravity and viscous force. Now, the oil drop moves with the constant velocity called $v_2$ called terminal velocity in upward direction. Let, Q be the total charge on the oil drop and E be the electric field strength.

<img src="/images/arro2.png" alt="arro2" style="zoom:50%;" />

For, Net force = 0

​		Upthrust + Electric force = weight + viscous force

​		or, Volume of air displaced x density of air x acceleration due to gravity + $QE$ = mass of oil drop x acceleration due to gravity + $6\pi \eta r v_2$

​        or, Volume of oil drop x density of air x acceleration due to gravity + $QE$ = mass of oil drop x acceleration due to gravity + $6\pi \eta r v_2$

​        or, $QE$  = mass of oil drop x acceleration due to gravity - Volume of oil drop x density of air x acceleration due to gravity + $6\pi \eta r v_2$

​        or, $QE$ = $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho g$ - $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\sigma g$ + $6\pi \eta r v_2$

​		or, $QE$ =  $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3(\rho -\sigma) g$ + $6\pi \eta r v_2$ 

​		or, $QE$ = $6\pi \eta r v_1$ + $6\pi \eta r v_2$                            [ From (i) ]

​        or, $Q$ = $$\frac{6\pi \eta r (v_1+v_2)}{E}$$                   ......................................................................(iii)

​		Substituting the value of 'r' from (ii) into (iii), we have

​          $$Q = \frac{6\pi\eta}{E}\sqrt{\frac{9\eta v_1}{2(\rho - \sigma)g}}(v_1+v_2)$$  ...................................................................(iv)

This is the required expression for the total charge carried by an oil drop. Knowing all the quantities on the right hand side of eqn(iv); through the series of experiments conducted for the oil drop of different sizes, Millikan determined that the value of charge $Q$ carried by an oil drop is an integral multiple of  $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$  which is the charge carried by an electron. So, the total charge $Q$ on the oil drop could be expressed as, 

​                                    $$Q = \pm ne$$   where, n = 1,2,3,..... and $e$ = $1.6\times 10^{-19}C$ 

Thus, Millikan's experiment proved the quantization of charge i.e. the charge on any charged object exists as an integral multiple of small minimum units called quantum of charge which is equivalent to $1.6\times 10^{-19}C$, the charge of an electron. This is known as the quantization of charge. 

## Motion of Electron in Uniform Electric Field ##

Let's consider two parallel plates separated by a distance **d** with upper plate maintained at higher(positive) potential and the lower plate is earthed so that a uniform Electric field of intensity**(E)** is produced between these plates. Let **V** be the potential difference between two plates as shown in the figure. Let an electron with an initial velocity **u** enters into the electric field, perpendicular to the direction of the field.

![electric](/images/electric.png)

​                                            *Figure: Deflection of the electron in an electric field*

Here, the velocity of the electron along the horizontal direction(X-direction) is uniform, so **$a_x = 0$**. The horizontal distance travelled by the the electron is given by, 

$$x = u_xt+\frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$$

$$x = ut+\frac{1}{2}.0.t^2$$

$$x=ut$$ 

Now,

$t=\frac{x}{u}$.....................................................................................(i)

Also, the vertical distance of electron along the y-direction is given by,

$$y=u_yt+\frac{1}{2}a_yt^2$$

$$y= 0.t+\frac{1}{2}a_yt^2$$ 

$$y=\frac{1}{2}a_yt^2$$ .................................................................................(ii)

The electric force exerted by the electric field on the electron which deflects the electron is given by,

$$F_E=ma_y$$

$$eE=ma_y$$

$$e\frac{V}{d}=ma_y$$

$$a_y= \frac{eV}{md}$$  ....................................................................................(iii)

Substituting eqns(i) and (iii) into (ii),

$$y=\frac{1}{2}\frac{eV}{md}\left (  \frac{x}{u}\right )^2$$ 

$$y=\left (  \frac{eV}{2mdu^2}\right )x^2$$ ...........................................................................(iv)

Equation(iv) is in the form of the equation of parabola. So, we can conclude that the motion of electron in an electric field is parabolic in nature.

<u>**Angle of deflection of electron in the electric field**</u>

Here, 

$v_x=u$ 

$$v_y=u_y+a_yt$$

​     $$=0+a_yt$$

​     $$=\frac{eV}{md}\frac{x}{u}$$

$$\therefore v_y=\frac{eVx}{mdu}$$

Now,

$$\tan\theta=\frac{v_y}{v_x}=\frac{\frac{eVx}{mdu}}{u}=\frac{eVx}{mdu^2}$$

So, the angle of deflection is,

###### $$\theta = tan^{-1}\left ( \frac{eVx}{mdu^2} \right )$$ ........................................................................(v)

The velocity of the electron at any point in the electric field is,

$$v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$$

   $$=\sqrt{u^2+\left ( \frac{eVx}{mdu} \right )^2}$$ ................................................................... (vi)

After crossing the electric field, the electron continues in its motion in a straight line path tangent to the parabola, because at that point, the applied electric field terminates, so no force acts on the electron to change its velocity. Thus, the gain in kinetic energy is given by,

$$\Delta K.E.= (K.E)_f-(K.E.)_i$$

​              $$=\frac{1}{2}m\left [ u^2+\left ( \frac{eED}{mu} \right )^2  \right ]-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$$   (Here, $E=\frac{V}{d}$ and D = length of the plate)

​              $$=\frac{1}{2}m\left ( \frac{eED}{mu} \right )^2$$ 

​              $$=\frac{e^2E^2D^2}{2mu^2}$$

## Motion of Electron in Uniform Magnetic Field

A magnetic field is induced around a charged particle in motion. When the electron having charge ($e$) moves in magnetic field ($B$) with velocity ($v$), its induced magnetic field interacts with the applied magnetic field which deflects the electron from its original path. The magnetic force experienced by the electron and its path of deflection can be explained at different angles of its projection in the field.

<u>i. When electron enters the field parallelly or antiparallelly, i.e.</u> ($\theta = 0^0$ or $\theta = 180^0$)

The magnitude of magnetic force is,

$F=Bev\sin\theta$..............................................................................(i)

For $\theta = 0^0$ or $\theta=180^0$, $\sin\theta=0$

$\therefore F = 0$

So, if the electron enters into the field parallelly or antiparallelly, the electron does not experience any magnetic force.

<u>ii. When electron enters the field perpendicularly, i.e.</u> ($\theta = 90^0$)

<img src="/images/intopage.png" alt="intopage" style="zoom:80%;" />

​                                    *Figure(i): Circular motion of electron in uniform magnetic field*

Then, the magnetic force experienced by the electron is,

$F = Bev\sin 90^0$

$F = Bev$........................................................................................(ii)

In this case, the electron experiences maximum force in the magnetic field. Since the force is perpendicular  to velocity $\vec{v},$ the electron moves in a circular path as shown in the figure(i). Here, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force to the electron,

i.e. $Bev = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

$Be = \frac{mv}{r}$

$$r = \frac{mv}{Be}$$.............................................................................................(iii)

Here, $r$ is the radius of circular path followed by electron in magnetic field.

Also, from eqn. (iii),

$\frac{v}{r}=\frac{Be}{m}$

$\omega = \frac{Be}{m}$

where, $\omega$ is angular velocity of the electron.

$\frac{2\pi}{T}= \frac{Be}{m}$

$T = \frac{2\pi m}{Be}$ ...........................................................................................(iv)

Here, T is the time period of revolution of electron in the uniform magnetic field. The frequency of revolution of electron is, $f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{Be}{2\pi m}.$

<u>iii. When electron enters the magnetic field at any oblique angle $\theta$</u> 

<img src="/images/helix.png" alt="helix" style="zoom:80%;" />

​                           *Figure(ii): Helical (spiral) motion of electron in uniform magnetic field* 

In this condition, the component of velocity which is parallel to the magnetic field tends to move the electron in linear path, whereas the perpendicular component of velocity tends to move the electron in circular path. So, due to the combined effect, electron follows helical (spiral) path as shown in the figure(ii).

Let, the magnetic field (B) be in the X-direction and the electron enters the field with velocity (v) at an angle $\theta$ with the magnetic field (X-axis). The horizontal component of velocity, parallel to the magnetic field (along x-axis) $v_x=v\cos\theta$  tends to move the electron along the direction of magnetic field (linear path) and its vertical component, perpendicular to the magnetic field (along y-axis) $v_y=v\sin\theta$ tends to move the electron in circular path. This combined effect makes the electron move in a helical path. 

The centripetal force provided by the magnetic field perpendicular to the velocity component ($v_y$) is

$$\frac{mv_y^2}{r}=Bev_y$$

$$\frac{mv_y}{r}= Be$$

$\therefore $ The radius (r) of the helical path is given by, 

$$r = \frac{mv_y}{Be}$$

$$r=\frac{mv\sin\theta}{Be}$$............................................................................................ (v)

Let T be the time period, then,

$$T = \frac{\text{circumference of the circle}}{\text{speed along the circle}}=\frac{2\pi r}{v\sin\theta}=\frac{2\pi }{v\sin\theta}\times \frac{mv\sin\theta}{Be}$$ [From eqn. (v)]

$$\therefore T = \frac{2\pi m}{Be}$$..............................................................................................(vi)

From equation (vi), it is clear that the time period of revolution of electron is independent of speed of the particle as well as angle of projection but depends on m, B and e.

The linear distance travelled by the particle during this time period is called the pitch of helix which can also be defined as the linear distance between two consecutive turns of a helical path. So,

Pitch(x) = horizontal velocity x time period (T)

​              = $v\cos\theta \times \frac{2\pi m}{Be}$

​              = $\frac{2\pi m v \cos \theta}{Be}$ .................................................................................(vii)
