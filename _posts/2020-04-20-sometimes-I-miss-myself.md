I was very introverted during my early teenage days. I shall blame it partially to how I was brought up and remaining to my intrinsic behavior. As time went by, and after a while when I look at it now I find myself in different territories. The person I am now is what time and situation have made me so. There are certain things in life that you wish would not have changed, even though time spares none. But it's very tough to keep your originality as time progresses. I have seen myself grow as well as many people who had been in touch with me as I have aged, and I still wish why we are so different now. Why can't I have the same person whom I had met many years ago? Why their personality has changed? More specifically, where their innocence has gone? Humbleness and innocence are the two important virtues I look at every person. It's very tough to maintain both humility and innocence, more now than ever before. The world has become so much chaotic than ever before along with the people around. It's up to the people to judge, but I wish I had the same innocence as I had when I was very young as I look at this picture now, taken around 15 years ago. Sometimes, I miss myself.
