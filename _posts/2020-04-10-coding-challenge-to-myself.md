Never in my stretch of the imagination, I wanted to be a teacher. But as it turns out, I have been in this role for a long time, albeit in a part-time role now as I have my research thing to look after. But, as things have turned out, I am enjoying this profession again. The main reason I am enjoying this profession again is I have found my love for learning again. Teachers should always believe in being lifelong learners. I had been coding for a while now, which I had started a long time ago, during my Bachelor's second year I guess. I self-learned Python, which I used sporadically; I never took it as a career prospect by any stretch of my imagination. It was all about picking something new and try. The way Python has evolved as a core programming language is amazing. During my master's, while we were learning about Fortran, I used to code for the same problem in Python. Programming gives you the tools to solve problems. Although I used to solve Physics problems using Python, I am trying to explore new options, as in Web development. Thus, I have challenged myself for 100 days of Code, by the time I will try to develop the tools to understand data used in my forte, which is Biophysics and develop a program that helps in the analysis of these data. So, I am adding another page where I will post my codes and summarise the progress I made during this challenge. Let's do it.
