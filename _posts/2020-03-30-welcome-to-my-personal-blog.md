Though I always had this planning of writing my blog, I was so much encapsulated by the daily works that I had forgotten this writing passion of mine, which I always wanted to develop. I never wanted to be a writer, a big NO !, but that should not stop me from pursuing this habit of talking to myself, or observing events around me and letting people know how I view things around, giving my perspective. I would try to make my blog as succinct as possible, my posts as regular as possible and remember, I never want to be politically correct, so there might be opinions of mine which you may not agree on. When the people are busy watching/listening more, I am downgrading myself into the world of writing and reading, for better I guess. You can also access resources that I have maintained for my students from the left side-bar. On the photography page, I will be uploading some of the clicks I have taken. 
Thank you !!!
