title: Self-introspection during lock-down

The pursuit of happiness is convoluted in so many ways, well I am not talking about the movie for now. During this lockdown, I had the better opportunity to pause, grasp my inner-self and look down the line about what I have achieved so far, more than that what I have learned so far. Things change right, as we evolve and as time progresses. But, we should always have time for self-introspection. I know it may sound shady because we have an ample amount of time during this lock-down for now, but this free amount I have got, may define my career ahead or shall I say, may give me a clear mind to progress myself forward. Time and again, I think people should always ask these questions to yourself, what do you want to achieve in life, how do you want to achieve it and are you doing necessary things to make that happen? Frankly, I had no such dreams while growing up and hence made no effort to move one step forward. But now, as I started knowing myself better, which I think is the most important thing; know and understand your vulnerabilities, make a peace with yourself, then you will realize you have opened a pandora's box full of opportunities. These all may sound clich√© if I don't put it into action.
