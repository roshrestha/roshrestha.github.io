I did not know what the letters on the image meant when I clicked it, but Martin Vögele correctly pointed out to me that it’s Japanese, whereラーメン means ramen.

During our recent trip to Chitwan, we came across this little sweet child, who just could not stop talking, :smiley: which left a long-lasting impression on all of us. I always have this feeling that travel is not only about exploring places, but also about sharing ideas and communicating with the people.

Teenagers of this era may be quite surprised to know that laping is not a new food that's very popular these days because of its spices. It's been in the food market for a long time now. If I can recall correctly, around 2 decades ago, my father used to get this for us at our home. But, I am so happy that different forms of this laping exist now which is getting popular day by day. Wanna have my share :yum:
